## Trend analysis display notes

Reviewed high-ranking and open access articles available in Google Scholar based on the search `trends in opioid death` and made notes of the key methods they used for calculating and communicating on trends in death.

## Overall notes
- The most common method for showing a trend is to report a percent change over a period: "200% increase in deaths from 1990-2000, computed as `100 * (2000_rate - 1990_rate) / 2000_rate`"
- Deaths are shown as counts and as rates (percent) per 100,000
- Other methods apply a model fit to the curve of deaths and might use that in a graphic display.

### Method notes
- Percent Change
  - (end_rate - start_rate) / start_rate
  - Expressed as percent change

### Method notes
- Rates per capita
  - Report rates per capita along with a 95% CI then reports percent change as above

### Method notes
- Rate charts and quadratic curves
  - Show quarterly rates with a quadratic (n^2) curve fitted and any inflection point highlighted
  - ", we used a Poisson regression model with linear and quadratic terms for time. Quadratic and cubic models were evaluated, and the quadratic model was chosen because it fit the largest number of programs. We computed the time of the maximum predicted value (vertex) of the curve, which indicates when the population rate changed from an increasing to a decreasing trajectory. A negative quadratic coefficient indicates that the quadratic curve is concave (with the apex at the top and the curve opening downward). The t-statistic was used to test whether the quadratic coefficient differed from zero. A significant result indicates that the quadratic term provided a better fit to the data than the linear term."
